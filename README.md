This project is made for searching for cheap flights from the city you input to the cities from your spreadsheet.
TEQUILA API and SHEETY API were used along with OOP.
Search is for +90 days from the moment you start the program.
Prices compared to 'history lowest prices' from spreadsheet, or whatever price you want to input there.
Printing results to console if such flight was found, otherwise prints "No such flights for NAME_OF_AIRPORT"
